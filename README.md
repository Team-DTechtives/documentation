The issue of safety at parking areas has become more relevant over the years. If the recent massive fires at parking lots in Bengaluru and Chennai in which hundreds of cars were gutted, are any indication, then it is high time we take a serious look at safety measures in these places.

“Given how congested our cities are, parking is not only a big problem but has also become a big business. In Mumbai, private parking lots charge about ₹300 for eight hours, but in terms of safety, many of them may not even meet the bare minimum norms,” says HV Kumar of HiVayKing Club, a network of travellers and bikers. “In India, risk management system of parking spaces is poor. Often, it is about simple logical solutions and even that is not followed.”

In the Bengaluru fire for instance, the dry grass on the ground is said to have caught fire, which aggravated by the wind, spread to all the cars. “The grass should have been mown as a preventive measure and the wind could have been controlled by erecting a temporary wall or divider,” says Kumar. “To contain the fire and mitigate damage, the space should have been equipped with fire fighting measures. All these lapses led to the accident.”
